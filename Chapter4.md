# Chapter 4: Slavery, Freedom, and the Struggle for Empire to 1763

## I. Slavery and Empire
Slave trade was a very profitable business in the 1700s, and control of it
meant great economic power.

Rising demand for cash crops like sugar, rice, coffee, and tobacco fueled
the growth of slavery.


### A. Atlantic Trade
The Atlantic trade system was one between Africa, North and Central
America, and Europe, that benefited a lot of people at the expense of
African slaves.

The main beneficiary of the Atlantic trade system was the plantation
owners in the Caribbean, but New England merchants also derived a
major sum of money from it.

As the trade grew, the association of black with slavery, and white
with liberty, grew as well.


### B. Africa and the Slave Trade
Slavery was supported by most West African rulers, eventually becoming
a necessity for survival because of the supply of European weapons the
trade provided.

Most African rulers and traders welcomed the Europeans and were
responsible for capturing the slaves.

Slavery, along with the influx of European goods, disrupted the West
African economy.


### C. The Middle Passage
The Middle Passage connected Africa and the Americas and was the most
prominent route of the slave trade.

The Middle Passage was a brutal experience for slaves, where on
average 20% of the originally healthy people died.

At first, the high death rate in North America meant that slaves
needed constant replacement, but soon the natural reproduction kept
up.


### D. Chesapeake Slavery
Virginia and Maryland depended on slave labor for mainly tobacco
cultivation.

Virginia and Maryland were mercantilist colonies that supplied Great
Britain with wealth generated from the tobacco trade.

Slavery expanded as Virginia did, but unlike in the Caribbean slaves
were employed in a great number of jobs on the plantations.

As land was consolidated to a few prominent families in Virginia, so
was its social hierarchy.


### E. Freedom and Slavery in the Chesapeake
Slaves were granted fewer and fewer freedoms as time progressed, and
as wealthy planters controlled more of the politics.

Chesapeakean laws confined slaves to an extremely restricted set of
rights, and violence from the masters was central in their laws.

Race and social roles were more tightly coupled as laws demanded free
blacks to move out of the colony.


### F. Indian Slavery in Early Carolina
The early Barbadian settlers enslaved native populations by
cooperating with the Creek Indians.


### G. The Rice Kingdom
The Carolinas followed Virginia's pattern of development, but with
rice and indigo instead of tobacco as their staple crops.

Initially, free blacks had more rights (as in Virginia), but as time
progressed rice and indigo became the staple crops in the Carolinas.

Carolinian planters had larger plantations and more overseers than
Virginian planters did because of the nature of rice.

The Carolinas adopted the "task" system rather than the constant
supervision seen in the Chesapeake.


### H. The Georgia Experiment
Originally founded to be a place of philanthropy, Georgia became just
another Carolina after the British crown took over.

Found by James Oglethorpe, Georgia was created to be a haven of slaves
and debtors.

Soon, the proprietors were forced to surrender the colony to the
British crown and a self-governing legislature was established.


### I. Slavery in the North
Slaves worked in all economic sectors in the North in contrast to the
South.

Slavery existed in the North, but only as small household servants
rather than peasants in the South, and had more rights than the
Southern slaves.

In New York and New Jersey, slaves constituted a higher population
percentage than they did in New England, but employers still preferred
waged laborers.

## II. Slave Cultures and Slave Resistance


### A. Becoming African-American
Africans had many diverse cultures and ethnicities, and brought their
own cultures to America during the re-Africanization, but the
experience of slavery bound them together.

The slaves onboard the ship on the Middle Passage was not a single
people in terms of culture or race, but slavery unified them as
African Americans.

Most slaves were born in Africa, and these newcomers worked harder
than Creoles for the hope of goign back to Africa.


### B. African-American Cultures
Different African-American cultures emerged from different parts of
the colonies, mainly related to the level of white involvement in
their lives.

Chesapeake slaves started reproducing since Virginian climate was more
healthy, and soon their interactions with white men made them start
learning English.

In the Carolinian and Georgian plantations, slaves enjoyed more
autonomy but were also harder worked; in southern cities, slaves
assimilated quickly.

Slaves in the north had fewer opportunities to create an African
American community, but had more liberties.


### C. Resistance to Slavery
The desire to be free made many a slave in all colonies to either
fight or flight.

A continuity in slave experiences is their desire for freedom, and
many ran away to cities like Charlesston or the north.

More violent forms of resistance were present in all American colonies
as well, such as the NYC Uprising of 1712 and the Maroons in Jamaica.


### D. The Crisis of 1739-1741
Many whites were afraid of the blacks after several slave uprisings,
and the fear culminated in the widespread hysteria in 1741.

During the War of Jenkins' Ear, South Carolinian slaves raided a
weapon shop and started marching towards Florida whose Spanish
governor promised freedom.

A panic in NYC led to hysteria that some African Americans were
plotting to destroy the city.

## III. An Empire of Freedom


### A. British Patriotism
As France became the major foe of Britain, British people (including
the colonists) united themselves with common symbols.

Britons and their colonists prided themselves as being the citizens of
the freest nation in Europe with a common law and a powerful
Parliament.

Common symbols of the British identity like songs, sports, and
religions emerged, most commonly used in contrast to those of France.


### B. The British Constitution
The British Constitution was believed to be one of the most advanced
during that time, and the colonists took great pride in their
liberties.

In the British system, the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and
the king or queen had checks and balances for one another, making the
British government one of the most advanced at that time.

Britons were contempt of other European nations, calling their
subjects as being "enslaved."


### C. The Language of Liberty
While all Englishmen said that they had "liberty," their notion of it
was very different and sometimes hyprocritical.

Commoners and politicians alike used the notion of liberty as the
rights to resist arbitrary rule.

Many protests for "liberty" in British territories were hypocritical
in nature.


### D. Republican Liberty
Republican ideals include representation of all "virtuous" citizens in
the government, encouraged by the writings of the Country Party.

Republicanism grew as liberty extended throughout the British
territories, but was limited to a certain group of "virtuous people".

Country Party writers criticized the lack of freedom of expression
when electing officials, just as the American colonists thought so.


### E. Liberal Freedom
John Locke asserted that there were certain rights of a man that
cannot be denied by a government.

While Republicanism focused on social equality, liberalism as proposed
by John Locke encouraged individual freedom of life, liberty, and
property.

Liberalism, as so many freedoms of the time, was excluded from groups
like slaves and women, but left a door open for those groups to claim
their rights in the future.

Republicanism and liberalism were different from the English view of
freedom, but were popular in the colonies.

## IV. The Public Sphere
In general, the politics in the colonies were more peaceful than in the
previous century.


### A. The Right to Vote
Even though the colonies extended suffrage to more people than Britain
did, only a small percentage of the citizens could vote.

In both the colonies and Britain, suffrage was based on property
ownership, but the system in the colonies was often more lax.

Few gender, religious, and ethnic minority groups were permitted to
vote.


### B. Political Cultures
People's voices got heard only in the Middle Colonies and on election
days.

The people's voices were unheard except only on election days, and
that influence is not major since most important offices were
appointed.

The offices were also *de facto* reserved for large property owner
because of legal constraints.

In other colonies, there a tradition of deference to the better-off
gentry during elections.


### C. Colonial Government
The colonial government is centered on the colonial assembly, and the
British-appointed governor was usually simply a figurehead.

The British crown adopted a policy of "salutary neglect" towards the
colonies, which led the colonial legislatures to be more powerful.

Colonial assemblies used their financial control to *de facto*
overrule the British-appointed governors.


### D. The Rise of the Assemblies
Assembly-legislatures in America gradually became the center of
political power, as the members of them gained more and more economic
influence.

The colonial assemblies resembled the House of Commons of the
Parliament in their freedom of speech and power of expression.

Governors usually failed in their wrestle for power with the
assemblies, especially in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.

The assembly members drew from the writings of the English Country
Party to emphasize their embodiment of the people's rights.


### E. Politics in Public
During this period of time, commoners gradually were more concerned
with the events in the political sphere and were more eager to voice
their opinions.

Parallel to the Latin-filled speech of the gentry, the common
citizenry also came to have a say in the discussion of policies.

Philadelphia and other northen cities were filled with coffee houses
and clubs where lively discussion of governmental policies took place
among all men.


### F. The Colonial Press
Reading in the colonies was a vital source of information & opinions,
from pamphlets to newspapers, in stores and libraries alike.

In contrary to the lack of presses elsewhere in the new world, people
in the English colonies were more literate and kept up-to-date by
newspaper and pamphlets.

After the establishment of the first library in Philadelphia, reading
became a fashion for free white men in all colonies.

Newspapers also grew during the 18th century, and transformed from
mainly information-based to containing political opinions.


### G. Freedom of Expression and its Limits
A freedom of expression, distinct in the American colonies, emerged
from the development of presses, despite political, legal, and
financial threats from authorities.

The English had no sense of freedom of expression apart from the
speech among Parliament members, and people could be jaild for
specific vocal behaviors.

The emergence of the press posed a challenge to the authorities, who
still attempted to restrain expressions in writing through censorship
and prosecution.

Elected assemblies were most commonly the source of opposition for
such freedom, and their will was usually complied with because of
their financial status.


### H. The Trial of Zenger
Zenger's acquittal sent a powerful message to the colonists that the
expression of popular opinions were protected by law.

John Peter Zenger, the publisher of an article criticizing the
governor, was tried for seditious libel, with an attorney who equated
freedom of speech as an essence.

With Zenger being acquitted, the freedom of demonstration was more
deeply ingrained in the American culture.


### I. The American Enlightenment
The Enlightment brought a resurgence of classical scientific ideas
into matters like religions, coinciding with the discovery of Newton
and the American Revolution.

Originating in France, the idea of Enlightenment with its praise for
scientific query arrived in America, whose spirit could be seen in
people like Benjamin Franklin.

The Arminians and the Deists, two major factions during the
Enlightenment movement, sought to use human and scientific reasoning
to clarify religions.

Deists like Franklin and Jefferson encouraged individual understanding
of nature and religious principals rather than congregational worship.

## V. The Great Awakening
Religious freedom was not *de jure* protected by law in most colonies, but
colonists were generally allowed to follow whatever faith they desired.


### A. Religious Revivals

In response to the call for objectivism from the Enlightenment,
religious leaders on both sides of Atlantic led the Great Awakening,
which was a return to early, more personal, church principles.

The Great Awakening was a counterrevolution established by ministers
of existing churches that aimed to make Christianity more personal,
i.e. a "religion of the heart" as the book calls it.

The movement was not limited to America or even Christianity, as
religious fundamentalism was seen in the Middle East in Islam and
Eastern Europe in Judaism.

Protestant ministers of many denominations pioneered a very emotional
style of preaching, usually about the impending damnation if one does
not follow the teachings of the church.


### B. The Preaching of Whitefield

Whitefield's popularity in the Americas with his appeals to emotions
and freedom of gaining salvation (i.e. non-Calvinist views) came into
conflict with the existing churches.

The English evangelist George Whitefield used highly emotional
preaching to convince that salvation was attainable with good
behaviors, and to encourage people to introspect into their own lives
as Christians.

Whitefield's preaching was highly popular in America, often to the
dismay of established ministers.

Even though some colonies like Connecticut sought to restrict
traveling preachers' movements, new churches were founded
nevertheless, with religious freedom their central doctrine.


### C. The Awakening's Impact

The Great Awakening encouraged colonists to have individual
consideration on the worldly and spiritual matters that were used to
be dominated by leaders.

Even though the Awakening itself was a spiritual movement, Revivalist
preachers were commonly the middle class of the society and preached
against the greed of the higher class.

Revivalist teachings also led some African-Americans and women to
become part of Revivalist churches, or even become preachers
themselves.

The Awakening both separated Americans who have conflicting religious
views, and united them as the Awakening called for individual
understanding of the Bible and of the world.

## VI. Imperial Rivalries


### A. Spanish North America

Spanish presence in North America was based on urban clusters like
Santa Fe, and although they claimed a large territory, they only had
*de facto* control of the land where they had settlers, which is not
very many.

Although a gigantic territory on paper, the Spanish North America was
consisted of very sparse population clusters in cities, with not many
people out of them.

Northern Spanish colonies like Florida, New Mexico, and Texas, despite
Spanish efforts to colonize, remained very small compared to the major
urban clusters in the south.


### B. The Spanish in California

The Spanish established an impressive string of missionaries in
California, but were not very successful at running them because of
the lack of interest from general colonists and local population
decline.

Motivated by the increasing Russian presence in Alaska, Spain ordered
the colonization of California, as Father Junípero Serra and other
missionaries founded missions and *presidios* in California.

Unfortunately, local Indian population decimated under diseases and
forced labor, while not many colonists were attracted to California.


### C. The French Empire

Similar to the Spanish, the French held an impressive amount of land
from NOLA up to Canada, establishing farming and trading societies,
but failed to attract as many colonists as the English.

The French were a more formidable enemy to the English than the
Spanish because of their geographic proximity, occupying a crescent of
land from New Orleans, LA, to Québec, Canada.

Continental French culture continued to consider colonization as being
an exile rather than an opportunity, discouraging peopling of the
region compared to the dense settlement by the English.

## VII. Battle for the Continent


### A. The Middle Ground

Home to several tribes who allied either the French or the English,
Ohio was a middle ground between Indian nations and European
settlements, though not for long.

Between the English settlements to the east and the Indian nations to
the west were a handful of "middle grounds" with people from multiple
tribes living together with constant European influence.

Indian tribes in the Ohio River valley formed alliances with the
French and English, sometimes playing them off each other and gaining
profit from fur trading with them.

The Ohio Company founded by Virginian colonists laid claims to the
land in Ohio, which was contested by the Pennsylvanians and the
French, the latter of which fought and lost in the Seven Years' War.


### B. The Seven Years' War

The beginning of their multicontinental dominations, the Seven Years'
War against the French was a failure at the beginning, until the
joining of Prussia and Austria in the struggle in Europe.

During the eighteenth century, England rose in influence and power
after its successful participation in many wars against other European
powers, though resulting in an increase in nation debt.

By 1750, the British had begun setting up a global empire, in which
they had imperial dominations in all continents, starting from the
Seven Years' War.

Unsuccessful at first in Ohio, Pittsburgh, and New York, the British
did manage to expel French and Indians in Nova Scotia.

Britain started to fund the war more aggressively with the tenureof
William Pitt, and the tide of the war turned as France became
preoccupied with continental affairs.


### C. A World Transformed

The British did come out victorious, but at a very high financial cost
for all combatants of the war.

At the Peace of Paris, the French ceded all Canadian territories to
the British, while the Spanish purchased the Louisiana colony.

The war drained finances of both Britain and France, precipitating
further struggles in both countries.


### D. Pontiac's Rebellion

A product of the rise of pan-Indianism, the Pontiac's Rebellion was a
struggle against further British settlements west.

The Indian nations grew more wary of the increasing domination of
British over their former territories, which was ceded by France as
part of the Peace of Paris.

Pontiac, an Ottawa political leader, and Neolin, a religious leader,
launched a rebellion against British forces that included all Indian
tribes of the disputed territory (pan-Indianism).


### E. The Proclamation Line

The British passed the Proclamation of 1763 as a result of the
Rebellion, and promised stability in the frontier, although nothing of
the sort was achieved.

The Indians besieged multiple British forts, but the British
eventually came out victorious (again), although passing the
Proclamation of 1763 in an effort to prevent such struggles.

Designed to stablize the frontier, the Proclamation prevented British
settlements farther west, although it only exacerbated the conflict
between the colonists and the Crown.


### F. Pennsylvania and the Indians

Pennsylvania was no longer a champion for Indian rights after its
participation in the war, and soon turned to the other extreme by
expelling all Indians from her territory.

With Pennsylvania's participation in the war, the original pacifist
Quakers resigned their seats in the assembly, bringing an end to
Pennsylvania's history of good treatment of Indians.

In 1763-64, several western Pennsylvanian families (called the Paxton
Boys) marched on to Philadelphia indiscriminately killing Indians, a
practice that resulted in wholesale expulsion of Indians at the end.


### G. Colonial Identities

The Seven Years' War was a binding force of colonists to form a
unified colonial British identity, just as it united the Indians.

The Seven Years' War heightened the colonists' sense of Britishness as
much it did to the Indians, although the first union attempts by
Benjamin Franklin were not successful.

Nevertheless, the colonists and British regulars formed a bond of
Protestantism against Catholicism of the French, and the colonists
felt more British than before.

The British empire now included very diverse peoples, from Catholics
of French descent to Indians in Asia, so many that the sense of
British liberty was diluted.
